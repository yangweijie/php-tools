# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing PHP GUI application from the `kingbes/libui` library to the `ardillo-php/ext` library. The application currently provides port killing and process killing functionality through a simple GUI interface. The new implementation should enhance the user experience by displaying query results in a structured table format with selection capabilities through checkboxes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from kingbes/libui to ardillo-php/ext library, so that I can have a more modern and maintainable GUI framework for my port and process management tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize using ardillo-php/ext library instead of kingbes/libui
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality for port killing and process killing
3. IF the ardillo-php/ext library is not available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide the same cross-platform compatibility as the original implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see port query results displayed in a table format, so that I can easily review and select multiple ports for killing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query for active ports THEN the system SHALL display results in a table with columns for port number, process ID, process name, and status
2. WHEN the port table is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a checkbox in the first column for each port entry
3. WHEN I select multiple checkboxes THEN the system SHALL allow batch operations on selected ports
4. IF no ports are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message in the table area
5. WHEN port data is refreshed THEN the system SHALL update the table contents while preserving user selections where applicable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see process query results displayed in a table format, so that I can easily review and select multiple processes for killing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query for running processes THEN the system SHALL display results in a table with columns for process ID, process name, CPU usage, memory usage, and status
2. WHEN the process table is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a checkbox in the first column for each process entry
3. WHEN I select multiple checkboxes THEN the system SHALL allow batch operations on selected processes
4. IF no processes are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message in the table area
5. WHEN process data is refreshed THEN the system SHALL update the table contents while preserving user selections where applicable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform kill operations on selected items, so that I can efficiently manage multiple ports or processes simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select one or more checkboxes and click a kill button THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before proceeding
2. WHEN I confirm a kill operation THEN the system SHALL attempt to kill all selected items and report the results
3. IF a kill operation fails for any item THEN the system SHALL display specific error information for that item
4. WHEN kill operations complete THEN the system SHALL refresh the table to show updated status
5. WHEN no items are selected and kill button is clicked THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no selection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive GUI controls for managing the application, so that I can easily navigate between port and process management functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a main window with tabs or sections for port management and process management
2. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain separate table states for ports and processes
3. WHEN I click refresh buttons THEN the system SHALL update the respective table data
4. WHEN I close the application THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup resources and exit gracefully
5. IF the window is resized THEN the system SHALL adjust table layout appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new implementation to follow modern PHP practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the migration THEN the system SHALL use proper object-oriented design patterns
2. WHEN writing new code THEN the system SHALL follow PSR coding standards
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement proper exception handling
4. WHEN managing GUI components THEN the system SHALL separate business logic from presentation logic
5. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN the system SHALL include appropriate documentation and comments
