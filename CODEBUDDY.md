## Project Overview

A cross-platform PHP toolkit offering GUI and CLI utilities (port killer, process killer, HTTP load tester) using kingbes/libui (native desktop via PHP-FFI).

## Code Structure

- **Entry Point**: `cli.php` (bin) using Laravel Zero commands in `app/Commands`.
- **PSR-4 Autoload**: `App\\` â‡’ `app/`
- **Core GUI**: `app/App.php` manages window and tabs; tool panels in `app/PortKiller.php`, `app/ProcessKiller.php`, etc.
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` contains post-install patches, watcher hot-reload, and utility scripts.
- **Config**: `config/` holds configuration files loaded at runtime.
- **Tests**: `tests/` directory, Pest + PHPUnit config (`phpunit.xml`).
- **Build Output**: `builds/` stores PHAR artifacts for each OS.

## Notes for CodeBuddy

- Follow PSR-12 conventions; use Pint for formatting.
- Use PSR-4 namespaces when adding new classes under `App\\`.
- Ensure GUI changes reflect in `app/App.php` tab registration.
- Use existing scripts (`dev.sh`, `dev.bat`, `scripts/watcher.php`) for hot reload.
